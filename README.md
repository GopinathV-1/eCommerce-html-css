eCommerce web site in HTML / CSS

![](picture/footer.png)

## What is done here?
   I have designed an eye-catching cricket-themed e-commerce website named Gully Corner.

## What are all used?
   I have done a responsive website so it will be user-friendly for both mobile and desktop users.
The website is created only for demo view. So, it will not be interactive with
the user. The website is built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
